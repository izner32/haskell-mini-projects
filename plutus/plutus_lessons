FUNDAMENTALS 
    utxo:
        eutxo:
    template haskell: similar to all plutus smart contract 
    on chain(validator script): code that is located on the cardano node or simply the blockchain
        - contains the datum/redeemer
    off chain: code that you would send to the on chain code 
    minting policies
    state machines 
    plutus paplication framework (paf)
    plutus paplication backend (pab)

    sample plutus smart contract flow 
        user wants to guess the box price 
            -> offchain
                - contains the input of customer's guess price vlaue
                - contains the ada he locked or pay to guess
            -> on chain 
                datum
                    - contains the box's price 
                    - contains the ada reward
                redeemer 
                    - datum must be equal to the customer's guess value
                        - if false do nothing 
                        - if true grab the ada reward from datum and release it to the user
    default plutus smart contract architecture 
        -> offchain (think of this as frontend where user interacts)
            - function for locking user's ada 
        -> onchain (think of this as backend)
            - datum: containing ada reward 
            - redeemer: condition to claim datum
